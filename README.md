An AI-powered Career Assistant prototype called 'CareerMate'.

The interface offers three core features:
- **Job Advisor:** A chatbot that suggests potential jobs based on a user's skills and interests.
- **Resume Grammar Checker:** Users upload a PDF file of a resume and the AI will output grammar corrections or wording improvements.
- **Cover Letter Generator:** Users input information for the job they are applying for, and the AI will generate a tailored cover letter.
